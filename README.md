"# MergeSort" 
An implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Python. The algorithm is implemented in the mergesort.py module, and is called and can be tested in mtest.py. The test accepts 2 command line arguments, the first being the number of subarrays to split the source array into per MergeSort call and the second being a flag for print debug info relating to what explicit steps the code is taking, this can be any value. 

To run the test file, you can either run mtest.py from the command line or simply run it like a regular app by clicking on the file assuming paths are set up properly.
